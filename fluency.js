/*The badge component in Bootstrap works the following way:

less/variables.less includes variables that less/badges.less uses to define badges.
less/bootstrap.less then includes badges.less to make the component. The bulk of the
object variation is in badges.less. Then, ~/Gruntfile.js converts bootstrap.less in to css.
